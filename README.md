Conceptual diagram representing different approaches used in this study to measure early warning signals of forest mortality; A) analysis of time series represents the dynamics of the whole ecosystem state variable, where the temporal signature is averaged over the whole ecosystem and after that leading indicator of critical transitions has been measured; B) following the approach provided in (A) but applied to the time series obtained from each pixel of a spatio-temporal time series that generates a spatial pattern of early warning signals; C) a new approach proposed in this study that measures local spatial autocorrelation (using local Moran’s I and local Geary’s c) at each time and generates early warning signals from time series of local spatial autocorrelation values at each pixel.
